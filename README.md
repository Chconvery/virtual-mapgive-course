# virtual-mapgive-course

Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) is working to improve the availability of high-quality, open geographic data to support humanitarian and development interventions across the world. The Department works closely with other organizations including Youth Mappers, Missing Maps, and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) to build and improve OpenStreetMap - an open and editable map of the world.

Virtual Intern tasks will include:

•	Contributing to OpenStreetMap through the HOT Tasking Manager. Intern will be required to spend at least 10 hours a month mapping and validating.

•	Evaluating data quality of spatial data produced in OpenStreetMap for MapGive supported mapping projects

•	Planning and organizing one Mapathon. A mapathon is a mapping event that educates the public on digital crowdsourced mapping and where volunteers work on mapping projects. 

•	Completing various tutorials covering useful and innovative geospatial platforms and software. There will also be various webinars that you will be invited to participate in.
