The objective of this assignment is to get you mapping right away in OpenStreetMap (OSM). OSM is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. Anyone can create an account and start contributing right away, and people do for all types of reasons. 

For this assignment you will create an account on OpenStreetMap.org if you don't already have one, complete the tutorial, and map some point of interests (POIs) in your neighborhood.

2. After you confirm your account visit https://www.openstreetmap.org again and Log-in. You will now navigate the map to view your own neighborhood. The map controls are similiar to other web maps you may have experienced before, with being able to pan by click and dragging your mouse, and there are controls on the right-hand side menu for zooming in and out (**add graphic). Try clicking on the 'Show My Location' (**add graphic) button and see if it takes you automatically to your location on the map.

After you are zoomed in far enough to your location the 'Edit' (**add graphic) button on the top-hand menu bar should stop being greyed out. Click on the 'Edit' button and it will open the iD editor, all within your web-browser!

Don't be intimitated, there is a great Walkthrough to help get you started. If the Walkthrough didn't pop-up automatically, navigate to the 'Help' button (**add graphic) on the right-hand navbar and click on the 'Start the Walkthrough' button (**add graphic). The Walkthrough will guide you along the basics including navigation and drawing map features.
