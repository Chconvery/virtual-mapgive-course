# Advanced Editing in OSM using JOSM

Want to level up our mapping? Many advanced users use the [JOSM editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM) for improved editing efficiency or specialized needs. JOSM is built using Java, and it gives you the option to use this free and opensource software by installing it on your Windows or Mac, or by just launching it on your machine without installing it. Only Java is needed, for either option get started by going to the [JOSM website](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/).

# JOSM Training resources

### HOT Community member Blake Girardot created a series of [introductory videos for learning JOSM](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54o5PaKgnbKU-vXe11cSmmsxIYnL5oDU)

### learnOSM.org has many [JOSM detailed editing](http://learnosm.org/en/josm/) resources in many languages.

### Mapbox launched [Mapping with OpenStreetMap](https://www.mapbox.com/mapping/) Mapping guides. The guides offer comprehensive training with JOSM including how to become a power mapper and validating OpenStreetMap.

### We also found this [JOSM Basic Manual pdf](https://ma.ellak.gr/documents/2014/09/%CF%84%CE%BF-%CE%B5%CE%B3%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-josm.pdf) on the web, it would be good for a print out.

## Additional JOSM tips:

#### Activate Remote Control. Make sure Remote Control is turned on (this allows the HOT Task Manager to send data directly to your JOSM session): go to Edit⇨Preferences; on the left click on the Remote Control icon (third from bottom), put a check in the box “Enable remote control”, click OK.
